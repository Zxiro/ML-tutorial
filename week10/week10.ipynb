    "## Phosphorylation site prediction\n",
    "> Phosphorylation is the most essential post-translational modification in eukaryotes \n",
    "and plays a crucial role in a wide range of cellular processes. \n",
    "Studies on kinases and their substrates are important for understanding signaling networks in cells, \n",
    "and helpful for developing new treatments to signaling defect diseases, such as cancer.\n",
    "> The number of kinases was estimated to be around 500â€“1,000 in animals and plants (Caenepeel et al. 2004; Manning et al. 2002; Vlad et al. 2008), and they usually induce phosphorylation on serine (S), threonine (T), tyrosine (Y), and histidine residues in eukaryotic proteins."
