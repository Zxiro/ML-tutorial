    "- Model combination nearly always improves the performance of machine learning methods.\n",
    "    -  With  large  neural  networks, averaging  the  outputs  of many separately trained nets is prohibitively expensive.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The choice of which units to drop is random.\n",

    "\n",
